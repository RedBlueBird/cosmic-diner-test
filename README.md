(quick prototype made in few hours, browser-based)

**Genre:** Cooking Simulation / Knowledge Roguelike / Eldritch Horror

**Summary:** Manage a diner that transitions from serving mundane humans to eldritch beings over a 30-day cycle.

**Description:** 

A "Knowledge Roguelike" where the player must learn the chemical and metaphysical properties of food to survive.
The expected duration of a standard run is 30 days long, broken down into 5-day arcs, with a Boss Customer at the end of each arc.

Currently just a 5-day human arc and a boss to test the feasibility and juiciness of this idea.
